# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made committment to 100 days of coding.

**Thoughts**: I'm a firm believer that reps are the best way to learn how to do anything better, whether its swimming or coding. I hope to come out of this challenge as a better coder! Today I'll be learning SQL in class and doing a few Codewars Katas to make sure I've got the fundamentals down.

## Day 1: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Feeling strong. Spent the previous day learning how to navigate and manipulate tables in an SQL database with a fun Carmen Sandiego themed exercise! This morning we've learning stacks and queues as data structures, followed by Python. Got a few Katas in and worked on my portfolio a bit!

## Day 3: February 5, 2022

**Today's Progress** Started the morning with some homework with Michel from class. Then worked a little bit on the portfolio. It's Saturday, I'm not going ham here! Still put some Python Katas in, at least!

## Day 4: February 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Still taking it easy for the weekend, or so I thought. Decided to work on a neat little opening icon for my portfolio. That took a few hours! Didn't hit any katas today!

## Day 5: February 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More class today! Learning Django is exciting, but definitely seems a bit more in-depth to set up! Knocked out a few Python Katas early before class. Also put in some work on the portfolio, seems I've finally completed some of the animations that have been bugging me for the last few days!

## Day 6: February 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made major headway on the portfolio today. Got all of the CSS and animations working. Now all I need to do is build out the back end and the projects page! Did a few Python Katas in class today. Also in class we built out another database using the Django REST Framework. The extra reps on Django are really helping, I'm feeling it come to me better. I still need my cheat sheets though!

## Day 7: February 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did more reps for Django and Postgres in class today. Didn't have time to do any katas, but I put a lot more work into my portfolio. It's basically done, but needs a little functionality here and there.

## Day 8: February 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Even more Django and Postgres, but now we're learning user authentication, which is a big part of what I wanted to know. Also now I know how to host files on AWS instead of trying to put everything on imgur and programming links myself! I finally finished off the portfolio, after some edits due to suggestions from friends!

## Day 9: February 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did an optional workshop with Esin this morning, while scrambling to come up with an idea for the final project for the class. Looks like I'll do a job board for indie game developers and designers. I'm calling it inDesign (get it?).

## Day 10: February 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Not a very exciting day for progress. Built out the backend for my final project using Django and Postgres. Managed to get everything deployed to Heroku without issue. Also, turns out inDesign is a program from Adobe, so changing it to inDecoders to avoid legal issues!

## Day 11: February 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Turns out there was an issue with my back end, I couldn't return a list of users, which would be handy for a job marketboard app. Stressed on it for a bit until I realized the Django REST Framework was taking up the users route. Just had to make a new 'getusers' route and it's all good! Whew. Now I'm gonna watch people play football. Hope they get some homeruns!

## Day 12: February 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent most of the day hooking the front end of my project to my back end. Had to watch a recording of Friday's lecture to make sure I was getting user authentication right. So far so good.

## Day 13: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did more work on the final project front end. Getting all the little pieces connected and working has been quite the challenge, but I think we're good to go. Had a little scare where the database quit responding to any of my requests. Tried to fix it nicely at first, but turned out dropping the database and reuploading it was the simplest solution.

## Day 14: February 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished up the majority of my final project. CSS is always my least favorite, but I finally found a good theme to use.

**Today's Progress**: Added media queries to my project to make it more responsive for desktop. Also did some difficult coding questions for a interviews. Rough stuff!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made committment to 100 days of coding.

**Thoughts**: I'm a firm believer that reps are the best way to learn how to do anything better, whether its swimming or coding. I hope to come out of this challenge as a better coder! Today I'll be learning SQL in class and doing a few Codewars Katas to make sure I've got the fundamentals down.

### Day 1: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Feeling strong. Spent the previous day learning how to navigate and manipulate tables in an SQL database with a fun Carmen Sandiego themed exercise! This morning we've learning stacks and queues as data structures, followed by Python. Got a few Katas in and worked on my portfolio a bit!

### Day 3: February 5, 2022

**Today's Progress** Started the morning with some homework with Michel from class. Then worked a little bit on the portfolio. It's Saturday, I'm not going ham here! Still put some Python Katas in, at least!

### Day 4: February 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Still taking it easy for the weekend, or so I thought. Decided to work on a neat little opening icon for my portfolio. That took a few hours! Didn't hit any katas today!

### Day 5: February 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More class today! Learning Django is exciting, but definitely seems a bit more in-depth to set up! Knocked out a few Python Katas early before class. Also put in some work on the portfolio, seems I've finally completed some of the animations that have been bugging me for the last few days!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made committment to 100 days of coding.

**Thoughts**: I'm a firm believer that reps are the best way to learn how to do anything better, whether its bench pressing or coding. I hope to come out of this challenge as a better coder! Today I'll be learning SQL in class and doing a few Codewars Katas to make sure I've got the fundamentals down.
